# Superheroes Minilab Due Wednesday, January 18, 2021  

This investigation asks you to work with the `heroes` data set, a modified version of the **superhero-set** data on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set). Use the `superheroes_dataviz_minilab.Rmd` template. I will pull the finished labs from GitHub so be sure to push to your repository when finished.
